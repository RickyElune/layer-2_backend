Please run this blockchain backend in Ubuntu based Linux or MacOS.

Tested in Linux Mint 20.1, everything works fine.

The running instruction for this backend is in "Part 5: Environment Setup" in our Project Report.

Here is a brief version.


Requirement: Please install

1. docker
2. docker-compose

on your machine.

Please refer to:
https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-docker-compose-ubuntu


To run this backend program:

1. Open Terminal, cd into "elixir-omg" folder.

2. Run the command:

   make init_test

It creates a file ./localchain_contract_addresses.env locally. It is required to have this file in the current directory for running any docker-compose command.

3. To bring all services up, run:

   docker-compose up

Once everything is done, you have a Watcher, Childchain, and database setup in your local machine. 
By now everything has been set up for Private Network.


If there is a trouble and you need to run again, you should:

1. Stop terminal process by press "crtl + c"

2. Clear docker. See "ClearDocker.txt" in folder "UsefulCommands"

3. delete "data" folder in "elixir-omg", which is generated by command "docker-compose up"

4. run "docker-compose up" again to restart
